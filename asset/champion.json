With the help of Nana, who was still younger than Irithel, she learned to speak like a human and also learned to fight, using ranged weapons. Irithel seemed to have a special interest in Crossbows. She regularly trained hard in the jungle and managed to master her crossbow, even after several failed attempts, while Leo grew up to be a strong adult smilodon.
